# About me

I am an enthusiastic and talented full stack software developer currently located in Helsinki Finland. I love writing clean and performant code, implementing beautiful and practical user interfaces, sipping coffee in daily scrums, and finding interesting things in large data sets. I am constantly looking for new challenges and interesting cutting edge technologies to work with.

I have written code since elementary school, but I have acquired my wide technical skillset from many years of software industry experience and encompassing computer science studies at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en). I have a master's degree in the Algorithms, Data analytics, and Machine Learning master's programme.

My professional background is long and varying. I have for example worked as a lead software developer in two start-ups, a software development consultant, a university teacher, and a research assistant. I love teaching software development at least as much as I love developing software. This is why I have engaged in teaching software development at the University of Helsinki and to become one of the authors of the [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course.

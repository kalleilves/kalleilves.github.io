# About me

I am an enthusiastic and talented Full Stack Software Developer currently located in Helsinki Finland. I love clean and performant code, beautiful and practical user interfaces, sipping coffee in daily scrums, and finding interesting things in large data sets. I am constantly looking for new challenges and interesting cutting edge technologies to work with.

I have written code since elementary school, but I have acquired my wide technical skillset from many years of Software Industry experience and encompassing Computer Science studies. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from Algorithms, Data analytics, and Machine learning programme.

My professional background is long and varying. I have for example worked as a lead software developer in two start-ups, a software development consultant, a university teacher, and a research assistant. I love teaching software development at least as much as I love developing software. This is why I have engaged in teaching software development in [the University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) and to become one of the authors of the [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course.
